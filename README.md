# lite-nagbar
nagbar for lite. Inspired by i3-nagbar.

### Installation
- for lite users, just download and place `init.lua` into your `plugins` directory as `nagbar.lua`
- for `lite-xl` users, download `init.xl.lua` instead

### Caveats
- debug functions are used to perform magic. It might be prone to breaking changes.
